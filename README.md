# PME-Portfolio-Analyzer
A PME (Public Market Equivalent) portfolio analyzer seeks to provide the most in-depth bench marking analysis possible for a given portfolio. This PME software compares the S&amp;P500 SPY index to each individual trade made within the portfolio. The PME returns the difference between the trade's performance, compared to what the performance of the SPY would have been in the exact same trade. Thus, the PME provides the user with information on what individual trades have over or under performed the market. Lastly, the PME compiles every individual trade's over or under performance into a composite record, which is then compared to the S&amp;P500 over that time-frame.

Seen below, the software prompts the user for the date desired for portfolio comparison. The user then uploads an excel file containing their portfolio information:
